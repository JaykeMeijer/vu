\section{Introduction}
This document is a follow up of the design document made earlier in this coarse. In the design document the idea of different types of synchronizing a concurrent datastructure where discussed and a hypotheses was made about the performance. In the following sections these hypotheses are proofen or disprooven.

\section{Testing}
The datastructures are tested with the shell file: \texttt{bin/test\_data\_structures.sh}. This script takes four parameters where the datastructes can be tested on.

\begin{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
test_data_structures <data_structure> <nrThreads> <nrItems> <workTime>
  where:
    <data_structure> in {cgl, cgt, fgl, fgt, lfl, lft}
    <nrThreads> is a number > 0
    <nrItems> is a number > 0
    <workTime> is a number >= 0 (micro seconds)
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Executing data\_structures.sh}
\end{figure}

With all the datastructures these parameters are changed in order to draw conclusions about the performance. 

Every data structure is called in the following ranges.
\begin{lstlisting}
<cgl, cgt, fgl, fgt, lfl, lft
	nrThreads: 1, 2, 4, 8
	nrItems: 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000
	worktTime: 0
\end{lstlisting}

The number of threads, nritems are clear. The worktime is a number in microseconds a thread waits before adding the next element. If this number is 0 the threads do not wait before adding the next element what means that the contention is high. If the workload increases, the of chance of high contention decreases.

\section{Lists}
The hypothesis about the performance is that it would perform the slowest of all the datastructures. The fact that no concurrent updates can take place because of the locks on te beginning of an update would basically mean that it is an iterative datastructure. 

The difference between the list and the tree are not
